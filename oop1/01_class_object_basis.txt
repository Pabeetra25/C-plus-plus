 OOPs - Classes and objects

C++ --> initially called --> C with classes by stroustroup
class --> extension of structures (in C)
structures had limitations
     - members are public
     - No methods
classes --> structures + more
classes --> can have methods and properties
classes --> can make few members as private & few as public
structures in C++ are typedefed
you can declare objects along with the class declarion like this:
/* class currency{
            // Class definition
        } Nepal, canada, Itly; */
 Nepal.currency =123 makes no sense if currency is private
